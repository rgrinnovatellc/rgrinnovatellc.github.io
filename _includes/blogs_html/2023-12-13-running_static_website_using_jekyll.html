<p><a href="https://github.com/uddhavgautam3/uddhavgautam3.github.io">Clone this GitHub repo</a> in your favorite IDE (e.g., Ruby Mine). You can re-write all git histories. Create a GitHub repo something like &lt;websitename&gt;.github.io. Then add your published SSH key, give read/write permissions, and configure page publishing in your GitHub settings.</p>

<p>In your local IDE (e.g., Ruby Mine), edit as you like and push. This should take less than 2 minutes to publish with new changes.</p>

<p>You must install Ruby and other build dependencies to be able to start your local Jekyll server.</p>

<p>Before pushing, you can test locally using the below commands:</p>
<pre>
    % bundle exec jekyll build
    % bundle exec jekyll serve
    % http://localhost:4000/
</pre>

<p>Any .md post files inside _post should follow naming conventions.</p>

        <p>
            I'm a Ph.D. researcher at Virginia Tech, focused on software engineering research, security in Android, IoT and Linux systems, and machine learning applications. I am being advised by Professors <a href="https://ece.vt.edu/people/profile/wangh.html" target="_blank">Haining Wang</a> (Chair) and <a href="https://security.vt.edu/about/staff/randy-marchany/" target="_blank">Randy Marchany</a> (Co-chair).
        </p>
        <p>
            With over 10 years of experience as a Mobile Engineer, Tech Lead, and Software Architect, I enjoy building tools that make systems faster, more secure, and easier to understand while writing clean, reliable code that lasts.
        </p>

            As the founder of <strong>RGR Innovate LLC</strong>, I turn research ideas into real-world software—creating mobile apps and DevSecOps solutions that solve practical problems.
